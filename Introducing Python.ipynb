    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Python is one of the most widely used programming languages, and it has been around for more than 28 years now. Python is designed to be very similiar to the nglish language and therefore simple to read and write. The point that it’s not a complex language is important. The designers placed less of an emphasis on conventional syntax, which makes it easier to work with, even for non-programmers or developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, because it’s considered truly universal and used to meet various development needs, it’s a language that offers a lot of options to programmers in general. The language is used for system operations, web development, server and administrative tools, deployment, scientific modeling and much more."
