# DataScienceTTS
My name is Millicent Schmidt, and I am currently a math and science teacher at a public arts conservatory high school in New Orleans. I am hoping to take my data analysis skills and scientific background and change careers. This year of teaching has been hellish, but I've been thinking about changing careers for a while. I will miss the kids though.

I would like to find a remote data science position to afford me more flexibility and work-life balance.
